Java streams utility methods for memoization

## How to replay Java streams?

Although java streams were designed to be operated 
only once, programmers still ask how to reuse a
stream? From a simple web search we can find many
posts with this same issue asked in many different
ways: ["Is there any way to reuse a Stream in java
8?"][1], ["Copy a stream to avoid stream has already
been operated upon or closed"][2], ["Java 8 Stream
IllegalStateException"][3], and others.

First, these questions are biased because many
programmers wrongly think on a `Stream` as an
equivalent to `Iterable`. But an `Iterable` is just
the ability to provide an actual `Iterator`, whereas
a `Stream` is just a kind of iterator. So, the right
comparison is between `Stream` and `Iterator` wherein
both have the same restriction disallowing multiple
traversals. 

Second, if we want to traverse a `Stream<T>` multiple
times then either we have to: 1) redo the computation
to generate the stream from the data source, or 2)
store the intermediate result into a collection. 
The first approach is similar to what we do when we
get an `Iterator` object from an `Iterable`. To that
end, we might wrap the stream expression into a supplier
(e.g. `Supplier<Stream<T>> source`) and call its method
`get()` whenever we want a fresh stream chain
(e.g. `source.get()`).

However what happens if data comes from the network, or
from a file or database, or other external source?
In this case, we must return to the data source again,
which may have more overhead than storing the intermediate
result into a collection. So for multiple traversals
on immutable data maybe the second solution is more
advantageous.
Yet, if we are only going to use the data once then we
get an efficiency payback using this approach, because
we did not have to store the data source in memory.

So shortly, both options have drawbacks and none of
them is best suited for all use cases. Here we will
explore the limitations and advantages of each approach
on data resulting from an HTTP request.
We will incrementally combine these solutions:
1. [using a `Supplier<Stream<â€¦>>`](#approach-1----supplierstream)
2. [memoizing the resulting stream into a collection](#approach-2----memoize-to-a-collection)
to avoid multiple roundtrips to data source
3. [memoizing and replaying items on demand](#approach-3----memoize-on-demand-and-replay)
into and from an internal buffer.

## Streams Use Case

`Stream` operations are very convenient to perform
queries on sequences of items and many times programmers
look for a way to consume a `Stream` more than once.
Moreover, in other programming environments, such as .Net
and Javascript, programmers does not stuck at this limitation
(one-shot traversal), because stream operations are not
provided at `Iterator` level, but instead at `Iterable`
level, which can be traversed multiple times.
So, in .Net or Javascript, we can operate on same data
with different queries without violating any internal
state, because every time a query is computed it will
get a fresh iterator from the source.

To highlight the drawbacks of alternative approaches on
reusing Java streams we will present a use case based on
a HTTP request. 
To that end we will use the [World Weather online API][4]
to get a sequence of items with weather information in
CSV data format.
Particularly, we are interested in a sequence of
temperatures in degrees Celsius in March at Lisbon, Portugal.
So we must perform an HTTP GET request to the URI
http://api.worldweatheronline.com/premium/v1/past-weather.ashx
with the query parameters `q=37.017,-7.933` corresponding to
Lisbon geographic coordinates,
`date=2018-03-01&enddate=2018-03-31` defining the dates interval,
`tp=24` to get data in 24 hours periods, `format=csv` to specify
data format and finally `key=` with the API key. 

To perform this HTTP request we will use a non-blocking API,
such as the [AsyncHttpClient][5], and the response will be
a sequence of lines in CSV format (e.g. `Stream<String>`).
Since we are using an asynchronous API, we do not want to wait
for response completion; hence the result of the HTTP request
is wrapped into a [promise][6] of that response. 
In Java a promise is represented by a [`CompletableFuture`][7]
instance (e.g. `CompletableFuture<Stream<String>`) and it is
obtained from the following HTTP request with the `AsyncHttpClient`:

```java
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile("\\n");
CompletableFuture<Stream<String>> csv = asyncHttpClient()
        .prepareGet("http://api.worldweatheronline.com/premium/v1/past-weather.ashx?q=37.017,-7.933&date=2018-04-01&enddate=2018-04-30&tp=24&format=csv&key=54a4f43fc39c435fa2c143536183004")
        .execute()
        .toCompletableFuture()
        .thenApply(Response::getResponseBody)
        .thenApply(pat::splitAsStream);
```

Now, in order to get a sequence of temperatures we 
must parse the CSV according to the following rules:
1. ignore lines starting with `#` that correspond to
comments; 
2. skip one line;
3. filter lines alternately;
4. extract the third value corresponding to temperature
in Celsius;
5. convert it to integer.

<img alt="weather-data-source" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/578217/39763003-ea99b4a2-52d3-11e8-86ed-a6ffae325cab.jpg" width="500">

To make these transformations without waiting for
response completion we will use the method `thenApply()`
of `CompletableFuture` passing a function that will
convert the `Stream<String>` into an `IntStream`.
Thus, when the resulting `csv` is available (i.e.
`Stream<String>`) it will continue processing the
transformation without blocking:

```java
boolean [] isEven = {true};
Pattern comma = Pattern.compile(",");
CompletableFuture<IntStream> temps = csv.thenApply(str -> str
        .filter(w -> !w.startsWith("#")) // Filter comments
        .skip(1)                         // Skip line: Not Available
        .filter(l -> isEven[0] = !isEven[0]) // Filter Even line
        .map(line -> comma.splitAsStream(line).skip(2).findFirst().get()) // Extract temperature in Celsius
        .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt));
```

Finally, we can build a [`Weather`][8] service class
providing an auxiliary asynchronous method
[`getTemperaturesAsync(double lat, double log,
LocalDate from, LocalDate to)`][9] to get a sequence
of temperatures for a given location and an
interval of dates:

```java
public class Weather{
    ...
    public static CompletableFuture<IntStream> getTemperaturesAsync(double lat, double log, LocalDate from, LocalDate to) {
        AsyncHttpClient asyncHttpClient = asyncHttpClient();
        CompletableFuture<Stream<String>> csv = asyncHttpClient
                .prepareGet(String.format(PATH, lat, log, from, to, KEY))
                .execute()
                .toCompletableFuture()
                .thenApply(Response::getResponseBody)
                .thenApply(NEWLINE::splitAsStream);
        boolean[] isEven = {true};
        return csv.thenApply(str -> str
                .filter(w -> !w.startsWith("#"))     // Filter comments
                .skip(1)                             // Skip line: Not Available
                .filter(l -> isEven[0] = !isEven[0]) // Filter Even line
                .map(line -> COMMA.splitAsStream(line).skip(2).findFirst().get()) // Extract temperature in Celsius
                .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt));// Convert to Integer
    }
```

## Approach 1 -- `Supplier<Stream<...>>`

Given the method `getTemperaturesAsync()` we can get
a sequence of temperatures at Lisbon in March as:

```java
CompletableFuture<IntStream> lisbonTempsInMarch = Weather
                .getTemperaturesAsync(38.717, -9.133, of(2018,4,1), of(2018,4,30));
```

Now, whenever we want to perform a query we may get
the resulting stream from the `CompletableFuture`.
In the following example we are getting
the maximum temperature in March and counting how many
days reached this temperature.

```java
int maxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch.join().max();
long nrDaysWithMaxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch
                             .join()
                             .filter(maxTemp::equals)
                             .count(); // Throws IllegalStateException 
```

However, the second query will throw an exception
because the stream from `lisbonTempsInMarch.join()` has
been already operated on first query.
To avoid this exception we must get a fresh stream
combining all intermediate operations to the data source.
This means that we have to make a new HTTP request and
repeat all the transformations over the HTTP response.
To that end, we will use a `Supplier<CompletableFuture<Stream<T>>>`
that wraps the request and subsequent transformations into
a supplier:

```java
Supplier<CompletableFuture<IntStream>> lisbonTempsInMarch = () -> Weather
                .getTemperaturesAsync(38.717, -9.133, of(2018, 4, 1), of(2018, 4, 30));
```

And now whenever we want to execute a new query we
can perform a new HTTP request through the
`get()` method of the supplier ` lisbonTempsInMarch`,
then get the resulting stream from the response through
`join()` and finally invoke the desired stream operations as:

```java
int maxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch.get().join().max();
long nrDaysWithMaxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch
                             .get()
                             .join()
                             .filter(maxTemp::equals)
                             .count();
```

To avoid the consecutive invocation of `get()` and
`join()` we can put the call to `join()` method inside
the supplier as:

```java
Supplier<CompletableFuture<IntStream>> lisbonTempsInMarch = () -> Weather
                .getTemperaturesAsync(38.717, -9.133, of(2018, 4, 1), of(2018, 4, 30))
                .join();
```

And now we can simply write:

```java
int maxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch.get().max();
long nrDaysWithMaxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch
                             .get()
                             .filter(maxTemp::equals)
                             .count();
```


Briefly, according to this approach we are creating
a new stream chain (with all the transformations
specified in [`getTemperaturesAsync()`][9]) every time
we want to consume that stream.
This idea is based on a claim of the Java documentation
about [Stream operations and pipelines][10] that states: 

> if you need to traverse the same data source again,
> you must return to the data source to get a new stream.

However this technique forces the recreation of the
whole pipeline to the data source which incurs in
inevitable IO due to the HTTP request. 
Since data from past weather information is immutable
then this HTTP request is useless because we will
always get the same sequence of temperatures. 

## Approach 2 -- Memoize to a collection

To avoid useless accesses to the data source we may
first dump the stream elements into an auxiliary
collection (e.g. `List<T> list =
data.collect(Collectors.toList())`) and then get a
new `Stream` from the resulting collection whenever
we want to operate that sequence (e.g.
`list.stream().filter(â€¦).map(â€¦)â€¦.`).

Using this technique we can transform the resulting
promise from the `getTemperaturesAsync()` into a new
promise of a list of integers (i.e.
`CompletableFuture<List<Integer>>`).
Thus, when we get the HTTP response and after it is
transformed into an `IntStream`, then it will proceed
to be collected into a `List<Integer>`:

```java
CompletableFuture<List<Integer>> mem = Weather
                .getTemperaturesAsync(38.717, -9.133, of(2018, 4, 1), of(2018, 4, 30))
                .thenApply(strm -> strm.boxed().collect(toList()));
```

With this `CompletableFuture<List<Integer>>` we can
build a `Supplier<Stream<Integer>>` that returns a
new stream from the list contained in the `CompletableFuture`.

```java
Supplier<Stream<Integer>> lisbonTempsInMarch = () -> mem.join().stream();
```

Now, when we ask for a new stream to `lisbonTempsInMarch`,
instead of chaining a stream pipeline to the data source
(approach 1) we will get a fresh stream from the auxiliary
list contained in `mem` that collected the intermediate
sequence of temperatures.

```java
Integer maxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch.get().max(Integer::compare).get();
long nrDaysWithMaxTemp = lisbonTempsInMarch.get().filter(maxTemp::equals).count();
```

Yet, this approach incurs in an additional traversal to
first collect the stream items. 
We are wasting one first traversal which is not used to
operate the stream elements (i.e. `strm.boxed().collect(toList())`)
and then we incur in a second traversal to query that
sequence (i.e. `lisbonTempsInMarch.get().max(Integer::compare).get()`).
If we are only going to use the data once then we get
a huge efficiency payback, because we did not have to
store it in memory.
Moreover, we are also wasting powerful "_loop fusion_"
optimizations offered by stream, which let data flow
through the whole pipeline efficiently from the data
source to the terminal operation.

To highlight the additional traversal that first occurs
on collect consider the following example where we
replace the `getTemperaturesAsync()` with a random
stream of integers:

```java
IntStream nrs = new Random()
        .ints(0, 7)
        .peek(n -> out.printf("%d, ", n))
        .limit(10);
out.println("Stream nrs created!");

CompletableFuture<List<Integer>> mem = CompletableFuture
        .completedFuture(nrs)
        .thenApply(strm -> strm.boxed().collect(toList()));
out.println("Nrs wraped in a CF and transformed in CF<List<Integer>>!");

Supplier<Stream<Integer>> nrsSource = () -> mem.join().stream();

Integer max = nrsSource.get().reduce(Integer::max).get();
out.println("Nrs traversed to get max = " + max);
long maxOccurrences = nrsSource.get().filter(max::equals).count();
out.println("Nrs traversed to count max occurrences = " + maxOccurrences);
```

The following output results from the execution of the previous code:

> Stream nrs created!
> 1, 0, 4, 6, 0, 6, 6, 3, 1, 2, Nrs wraped in a CF and transformed in CF<List<Integer>>!
> Nrs traversed to get max = 6
> Nrs traversed to count occurrences of max = 3

Note, when the resulting stream (i.e. `nrsSource.get()`)
is traversed by the `max()` operation, the stream from
data source `nrs` has already been computed by the
`collect()` operation resulting in the output:
`1, 0, 4, 6, 0, 6, 6, 3, 1, 2,`.
So, instead of executing just 2 traversals to compute
2 queries: the maximum value and the number of occurrences
of the maximum value; we are performing one more traversal
first that is not used in none of the end queries.
